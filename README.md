# Swing With King — Market Tracking Methodology

This repository documents the thinking and discipline behind the Swing With King approach to the stock market.

The focus is not prediction or hype, but consistency, risk awareness, and emotional control.

## Purpose

Most investors lose money because they trade emotionally, overtrade, and ignore market context.
This methodology prioritizes structure and patience over activity.

## What This Covers

- How overall market direction is evaluated before trading
- Why market context matters more than individual stock picks
- How risk management and position sizing reduce drawdowns
- The importance of logging decisions and outcomes consistently

## Daily Market Breakdown (Concept)

A daily market breakdown focuses on:
- Market direction and risk environment
- When participation makes sense — and when it doesn’t
- Avoiding emotional trades during uncertain conditions

The goal is to filter bad trades before they happen.

## Philosophy

This approach emphasizes:
- Survival before profit
- Process over prediction
- Alignment with market conditions
- Fewer, higher-quality decisions
